There's not much to put here yet. :(

This repo as of now contains two files, one which is a database creation script for SQL Server 2016, 
and one which is the actual T-SQL code that runs the game.

You don't have to use the database creation script, there is nothing special about the configuration.

Right now, this code is straight nasty, cursors and apply's and dynamic SQL oh my. 
But it works in a logical, easy to follow way.

The goal is to get this working in a way that is much faster than the ~44 seconds for 2 generations
that I get on my PC running SQL Express on an SSD.

This will be updated as the project progresses.
